Overview

The Java interface is a simple program that takes two inputs from the user, formats them, and then sends them off to the server.  It periodically checks the server to see if the job is finished, and then displays the results when necessary.

The difficulty in this program was not the functionality, as it is a fairly simple task.  The difficulty was learning how to use JavaFX from scratch.  There are tutorials online, but I’ve found that it’s fairly difficult to make things look like you want them to.  Luckily, I’ve figured it out, and am now decent at using JavaFX.  I imagine I will use JavaFX for future projects.

Running

To run the code, download the project files and import into a Java IDE.
